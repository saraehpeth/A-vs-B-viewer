Nice — excellent brief. I assembled a concise, source-backed timeline you can drop into a seminar slide or handout for your partners and staff. I focused on AICPA (and related CPA.com/CAQ activity) from 2023 → late-2025, with short notes on why each item matters and how AICPA’s messaging/lobbying evolved. I also included a short “what changed” synthesis and a small suggested slide/handout outline you can use.

# Timeline (selected, source-backed — 2023 → 2025)

**June 7, 2023 — CPA.com launches Generative AI initiative**
Why it matters: CPA.com (AICPA’s technology arm) publicly kicked off an organized effort to educate the profession on GenAI possibilities and risks (foundation for later toolkits, training, and firm guidance). ([Journal of Accountancy][1])

**Oct 1, 2023 — AICPA debuts “Practice Aid for Tech-Enabled Auditing”**
Why it matters: First formal practice-aid style guidance discussing commonly used automated tools and techniques — shifted messaging from “ignore/ban” to “how to use/assess” technology in audit workflows. Useful baseline for audit quality and documentation expectations. ([AICPA & CIMA][2])

**Oct 2023 (late Oct) — CPA.com / CPA.com GenAI Toolkit and resources released**
Why it matters: Practical toolkits for firms (risk checklists, governance, use-case examples). Showed CPA.com/AICPA moving rapidly from awareness to practical adoption resources for member firms. ([CPA.com][3])

**April–June 2024 — Regulators & standard-setting bodies publish guidance/reports on AI & tech (CAQ whitepaper; AICPA updates on digital assets auditing)**
Why it matters: The profession’s conversation broadened — regulators and oversight groups (e.g., CAQ, PCAOB/others) flagged inspection observations and expectations; AICPA updated practice aids (e.g., digital assets) to keep pace with tech-driven audit issues. Signals coordination across profession/regulators. ([The Center for Audit Quality][4])

**Sept 11, 2024 — AICPA article: state lawmakers continuing to focus on AI policy**
Why it matters: AICPA recognized and began tracking state-level AI proposals and task forces — message expanded from firm operations to public policy & advocacy. Firms needed to watch differing state rules. ([AICPA & CIMA][5])

**May 6, 2025 — AICPA & CPA.com AI Symposium (takeaways published)**
Why it matters: AICPA convened experts & regulators; public summary showed active engagement with policymakers and emphasis on profession’s role in third-party assurance, standards, and risk management for AI systems. Demonstrates move from internal practice aids to external influence and consensus-building. ([CPA.com][6])

**Mar 14, 2025 — AICPA submits Comment Letter on the Federal AI Action Plan (multi-agency initiative following 2025 Executive Order)**
Why it matters: AICPA provided formal comments to federal AI policy efforts (NITRD/NCO/NSF/OSTP) about assurance over AI systems and the role of third-party assurance — clear pivot to national advocacy on AI governance and assurance. This is a major milestone in AICPA’s lobbying/positioning. ([AICPA & CIMA][7])

**Mid–Late 2025 — AICPA advocacy pushes several federal/state wins and further resources**
Why it matters: AICPA advocacy continued to be active across tax, workforce, and technology policy; CPA.com/AICPA continued producing toolkits and (by late Oct 2025) building internal GenAI products to help members (e.g., AICPA’s Josi product announcement). Shows sustained investment in both policy and member tools. ([AICPA & CIMA][8])

**(Contextual/regulatory note)** — PCAOB and SEC speeches / inspection work during 2024–2025 increasingly mention tech risks (auditing AI outputs, model governance). Firms should expect inspection attention where tech materially supports audit evidence. ([Default][9])

# What changed (2023 → 2025) — short synthesis

* **2023:** Education and preparedness — CPA.com and AICPA focused on raising awareness, producing toolkits and practice aids so firms could experiment safely. Messaging = “learn, pilot, govern.” ([Journal of Accountancy][1])
* **2024:** Coordination and scrutiny — regulators (CAQ, PCAOB, SEC) and states started highlighting risks and inspection observations. AICPA updated practice aids (digital assets, tech-enabled auditing) to reflect new risk vectors. Messaging = “use with controls; expect regulatory attention.” ([The Center for Audit Quality][4])
* **2025:** Advocacy and assurance — AICPA stepped into formal policymaking (comment letters on federal AI action plans) and convened stakeholders. The association’s role expanded beyond member guidance to shaping what third-party assurance and AI governance should look like. Messaging = “profession must help set assurance standards and public policy.” ([AICPA & CIMA][7])

# Practical implications for your firm (short list)

1. **Governance & policy:** Adopt clear firm policies for GenAI use (data inputs, confidentiality limits, permitted vendors). See CPA.com toolkits. ([CPA.com][3])
2. **Audit methodology updates:** Document how AI/automation are used as audit evidence, control testing, and model validation. Use AICPA practice aids as reference. ([AICPA & CIMA][2])
3. **Third-party assurance readiness:** Expect requests/standards around assurance over AI systems — AICPA is actively advocating that assurance frameworks be established. ([AICPA & CIMA][7])
4. **Training & risk awareness:** Rapid staff training, plus cybersecurity/data-handling rules for prompts and datasets. CPA.com guidance covers practical safeguards. ([CPA.com][10])
5. **Regulatory watchlist:** Monitor state AI laws and PCAOB/SEC statements — treatment may vary by jurisdiction and inspection focus. ([AICPA & CIMA][5])

If you’d like, I can **immediately** convert the timeline + practical implications into a polished 6-slide PowerPoint (speaker notes included) tailored for your audience (15 partners + 30 staff). I can also expand the timeline into a one-page handout sized for printing. Which would you prefer?
