## File Naming Convention

**Version-based naming** to show the iterative refinement process:

```
v1-Prompt-[Topic].md           ← Original prompt
v1-Response-Claude.md          ← Claude's response to v1
v1-Response-GPT.md             ← GPT's response to v1

v1-to-v2-Evolution.md          ← Why/how the prompt was refined

v2-Prompt-[Topic].md           ← Refined prompt
v2-Response-Claude.md          ← Claude's response to v2
v2-Response-GPT.md             ← GPT's response to v2

v2-Analysis.md                 ← What we learned from v2
```

Files sort alphabetically in chronological order, making it easy to follow the evolution.

## Current Comparisons

### v1: AICPA AI Positioning Timeline

**Original prompt**: Asked for a timeline of AICPA messaging on AI

**Evolution**: Realized the prompt asked for compilation but we actually wanted analysis of their position (pro-professional vs pro-automation) and potential conflicts of interest

**Status**: v1 complete, v2 in progress
