I'll search for current AICPA guidance on AI to see how their policies have evolved since 2023.Based on my research, here's what's evolved with AICPA guidance on AI from 2023 to now:

## The Core Reality: No Formal Code Changes

The AICPA hasn't amended the Code of Professional Conduct to specifically address AI. Instead, they're applying existing ethical principles—competence, due care, professional skepticism, and supervision—to AI use. This is actually significant for your seminar: it means CPAs can't hide behind "there's no guidance yet."

## What Has Changed (2024-2025)

**Educational Resources Developed:**
- AICPA partnered with CPA Canada on an AI series including "Navigating the AI Revolution: Key Updates for Today's CPA" and two-part "Closing the AI Trust Gap" papers
- CPA.com released the "2025 AI in Accounting Report" in June 2025 at ENGAGE
- New AI Tax Resource Center launched
- Multiple webcasts on ethics and AI

**Key Guidance Principles Emerging:**

CPAs must exercise the same due diligence when using AI as they would when relying on staff or experts—meaning proper review and oversight of AI outputs is mandatory, and automation bias is recognized as a professional risk requiring skepticism.

AICPA is positioning CPAs as potential AI system evaluators/auditors, with frameworks like NIST AI Risk Management Framework being referenced for AI governance assessments.

## The Professional Liability Angle (Critical for Your Seminar)

As of January 2024, there was still no authoritative AICPA guidance on AI in SOC reports or attestation engagements—practitioners are working in a gap, applying SSAE 18-21 standards as best they can.

For tax work specifically: SSTS standards on due diligence apply fully to generative AI use—practitioners must ensure reasonable inquiry, accuracy, and adequate documentation just as with any other tool.

## What This Means for Your Firm

The lack of specific AI amendments creates both risk and opportunity. Firms using AI without understanding these existing obligations face liability. But firms that can demonstrate thoughtful application of professional standards to AI use—treating it like expert consultation requiring oversight rather than magic—differentiate themselves.

This gap between "no specific rules" and "all existing rules apply" is exactly where mindful vs. mindless AI use diverges. Would you like me to help develop talking points on how existing CPA obligations map to different AI training approaches?
